jekyll-gettext-plugin
=====================

A quick and dirty i18n plugin for jekyll based on gettext and po files  

Inspiration taken from [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin](https://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin), it was just a little overkill for my needs and I wasn't a fan of managing translations in yaml files.
