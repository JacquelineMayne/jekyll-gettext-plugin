# Jekyll::Gettext::Plugin

A quick and dirty i18n plugin for jekyll based on gettext and po files  

Inspiration taken from [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin](https://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin), it was just a little overkill for my needs and I wasn't a fan of managing translations in yaml files.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'jekyll-gettext-plugin'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
